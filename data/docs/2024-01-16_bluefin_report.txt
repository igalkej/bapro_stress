BLUEFIN ECONOMIC COMMENTARY — SOUTHERN CONE MARKETS
Tuesday, January 16, 2024

Tuesday's session maintained the constructive recovery tone, though our stress indicators remain in mildly elevated territory as investors await the decisive mid-week IMF communication. Argentine assets broadly firmed, with spread compression continuing and the FX gap gradually narrowing. The session is best characterized as "watchful recovery."

FX DYNAMICS

The CCL closed at 1,046 ARS/USD — another incremental improvement. The gap versus official has narrowed to 28.4%, approaching the psychologically important sub-28% threshold that prevailed before the first Jan 5 stress event. The BCRA reported net MULC purchases of $71 million — the strongest session in two weeks — as export settlement inflows improved (early agricultural dollar flows ahead of soy harvest season) and import demand normalized from the spike levels of last week.

The parallel (blue) informal rate settled near 1,065, reflecting residual speculative demand but no panic buying. The informal market spread over CCL has narrowed to approximately 1.8% — within normal range.

RESERVE UPDATE

BCRA gross reserves printed at $22.19 billion — the highest in three weeks. The recovery from the Jan 11 low of ~$21.95 billion is encouraging. Our team models that the net reserve position (excluding swaps and other liabilities) is approximately negative $5.8 billion — improved from negative $6.2 billion at end-December but still deeply negative on a strict basis. IMF program compliance will hinge on the agreed definition, with negotiations reportedly focusing on whether PBOC swaps are counted at full utilization or only partially.

SOVEREIGN BONDS

GD30 rose 0.7 cents — now recovered to approximately 85% of the pre-stress (Jan 3–4) level. EMBI+ Argentina tightened another 47 bps to 1,758 bps. This is within striking distance of the pre-Jan 5 level of ~1,760 bps. Carry demand is firmly driving the compression: Argentine yield spreads in the 25–28% range are attracting dedicated EM credit allocators who see the current government's fiscal commitment as credible in the near term.

MONETARY AGGREGATE WATCH

The stock of BCRA remunerated liabilities declined marginally last week — the first weekly contraction since the new government took office. This reflects the Treasury's success in rolling over peso debt without additional monetary financing, which is a key positive signal for the quasi-fiscal trajectory. If sustained, this could be a turning point in the monetary normalization process.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

U.S. equity markets reopened after the holiday; equities broadly positive and 10-year UST retreated to 4.07% as early Fed speak (Bostic) signaled patience but maintained easing bias. EM credit spreads broadly tighter. China's Q4 GDP print (+5.2% YoY, in line with the annual target) supported a mild risk-on backdrop for EM broadly.

OUTLOOK: MILDLY ELEVATED, IMPROVING

We are cautiously optimistic heading into the IMF communication. The technical recovery in Argentine assets is intact and, if the IMF provides positive guidance on reserve definitions and program compliance, we expect a meaningful spread compression toward the 1,700–1,720 bps range. Our base case remains a constructive outcome, with downside scenario (IMF standoff) carrying roughly 25% probability at this stage.
