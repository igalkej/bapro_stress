RAP DAILY BRIEF — ARGENTINA PORTFOLIO ADVISORY
Tuesday, January 30, 2024

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Tuesday session was uneventful in the best possible sense — quiet, orderly, constructive. Argentine assets held near cycle highs as the market waited for the Fed FOMC decision (due Wednesday). Volumes are slightly below Monday's elevated level, suggesting position consolidation rather than new buying. The orderly flows environment is intact.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

1. FX: CCL at 991 ARS/USD. The FX gap is 21.9% versus official — essentially flat from yesterday, showing stabilization at these compression levels. BCRA net MULC purchases of $94 million — robust. The blue parallel market is very quiet; the spread between CCL and blue is essentially zero, indicating complete convergence between the financial and informal market exchange rates.

2. Reserves: Gross reserves at $23.74 billion — nearly flat from yesterday (minor valuation adjustment). The BCRA confirmed that the net reserve position has improved by approximately $1.4 billion since December 31, attributable to MULC accumulation, the IMF disbursement, and import payment compression.

3. Sovereign bonds: GD30 at 88.4 cents — fractionally higher; very quiet. Country risk at 1,544 bps — the tightest reading of 2024. The market is consolidating at these levels rather than extending, suggesting a brief pause before the next leg of compression (which most desks expect will require either a formal primary surplus print for January or another positive IMF signal).

4. Equities: Merval essentially flat (+0.3% in pesos). The pause is healthy — the index has gained approximately 12% in CCL terms since the Jan 17 stress trough and a brief consolidation is technically expected. No sector outperformers today.

5. Rates: T-bill yields at ~113% AEA — approaching the lowest level since the new administration's policy rate adjustment in December. The implied real rate is still negative on a monthly basis, consistent with the financial repression that is funding the Treasury's debt rollover.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

Fed FOMC day tomorrow — no change expected. The market is pricing Powell's messaging very carefully. 10-year UST at 4.00% (round number holds). EM assets broadly quiet as investors await the Fed. No significant EM event risk today. Oil stable at $81.0/bbl.

RISK MONITOR: CALM — ORDERLY CARRY FLOWS

Conditions are deeply calm. Our stress indicator is at -0.64 — one standard deviation below neutral, indicating positive (low-stress) market conditions for Argentine assets. The dominant market dynamic is carry demand. We remain positioned for continued compression in sovereign bonds and sustained equity outperformance in the energy sector. No active risk management needed at current levels.
