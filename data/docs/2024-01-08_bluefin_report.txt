BLUEFIN ECONOMIC COMMENTARY — SOUTHERN CONE MARKETS
Monday, January 8, 2024

Markets began the week in recovery mode following Friday's sharp deterioration, but the session was far from tranquil. Argentine risk assets staged a partial rebound after the economic team issued a clarifying statement over the weekend affirming that IMF discussions were ongoing and "technically constructive." The statement was enough to prevent a further cascade but insufficient to restore the pre-Friday equilibrium.

FX UPDATE

The CCL (blue-chip swap) retreated from Friday's close of 1,077 to approximately 1,051 — still elevated relative to the week-ago level of ~1,034. The FX gap narrowed to around 29.1% from Friday's alarming 32.2%, suggesting that the weekend communication provided some stabilizing effect. The BCRA resumed small-scale dollar purchases in the MULC — net purchases estimated near $30 million, a far cry from the $50–100 million daily pace seen in the first week. Import demand is clearly elevated following Friday's dollar scare.

SOVEREIGN BONDS: TECHNICAL RECOVERY

Argentine hard-currency bonds recovered partially. GD30 gained 0.9 cents, GD35 up 0.7 cents. Country risk (EMBI+) tightened 44 bps to 1,797 bps but remains well above the pre-stress level of ~1,760. Traders noted that the recovery was driven by opportunistic buyers — domestic banks and EM-dedicated funds — rather than a broad risk-on shift, suggesting fragility in the bounce. Bid-ask spreads in the sovereign complex remain wider than normal.

MONETARY SITUATION

Our team is closely monitoring the BCRA's handling of peso liquidity. The stock of remunerated liabilities grew by another 2.1 trillion pesos last week, and the implied interest cost (at current rates around 100% annual effective) continues to expand the quasi-fiscal deficit. The government's strategy involves transitioning these instruments toward Treasury-issued bonds, but the timeline and market absorption capacity remain uncertain — a key medium-term vulnerability.

GLOBAL BACKDROP

U.S. markets are adjusting to the post-payroll repricing: Fed funds futures now imply a first cut in May rather than March, and the 10-year Treasury is consolidating near 4.04%. EM credit spreads are broader broadly but not dramatically wider. China's weekend data showed continued weakness in the manufacturing PMI (49.2), tempering the soft commodity demand outlook — mildly negative for Argentina's soy export revenues. Brent crude stabilized near $76.2/bbl.

OUTLOOK: ELEVATED, RECOVERING

We classify Friday's episode as a sharp but partially-contained stress event. The situation warrants close monitoring: any new negative signal on the IMF front or a resumption of reserve losses could quickly re-escalate. Carry demand has reasserted itself at current spread levels, providing a floor, but the risk/reward for adding Argentine exposure has deteriorated since Thursday's close. We remain cautiously positioned, overweight cash equivalents within the Argentina allocation.
