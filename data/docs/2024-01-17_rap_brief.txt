RAP DAILY BRIEF — ARGENTINA PORTFOLIO ADVISORY
Wednesday, January 17, 2024
*** THIRD STRESS SPIKE — IMF BREAKDOWN FEARS ***

Today's session delivered the third and most severe stress episode of January, triggered by an unexpected and highly damaging leak from IMF sources suggesting that Argentina's reserve accumulation targets for Q1 2024 may be missed by a wide margin, and that a formal program review could be delayed. The reaction across Argentine asset classes was swift, broad, and severe.

THE CATALYST

At approximately 10:45 AM Buenos Aires time, a Reuters report citing "an IMF official familiar with the matter" indicated that the current pace of reserve accumulation — while positive in headline terms — fell short of the confidential Q1 target embedded in the Extended Fund Facility framework under negotiation. Additionally, the source suggested that the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department had flagged concerns about the accounting treatment of electricity subsidy liabilities as off-balance sheet items, potentially understating the fiscal deficit by 0.3–0.5% of GDP. This was a bombshell for a market that had been expecting a clean bill of health.

FX MARKET MELTDOWN

The CCL (blue-chip swap) surged 5.8% intraday, reaching a session high of 1,107 ARS/USD — a new high for 2024 — before closing at 1,096. The FX gap blew out to 34.9% versus the official rate of 813, the widest since the pre-devaluation peak in early December 2023. The BCRA reportedly conducted substantial dollar sales in the MULC — estimated $145 million — to prevent a disorderly official rate move, depleting gross reserves to $22.03 billion. The accumulation of the past week was entirely reversed in a single session.

DEFAULT RISK SURGES

Argentine sovereign bonds suffered the worst single-day loss of 2024. GD30 fell 3.2 cents on the dollar — a 4.1% daily decline for an instrument priced near 77 cents. GD35 dropped 3.8 cents, approaching the psychologically important 50-cent level. EMBI+ Argentina spread exploded 178 bps wider to 1,936 bps, the highest level since November 2023. Argentine CDS for 5-year protection surged to 1,958 bps. Market commentators noted that "widening spreads of this magnitude in a single session imply the market is seriously re-pricing the probability of debt restructuring or outright default in the medium term."

Three major EM credit desks reportedly reduced Argentine exposure to underweight in their portfolios — a forced seller dynamic that amplified the losses beyond what fundamental repricing alone would justify.

EQUITIES: CIRCUIT BREAKER TERRITORY

The Merval index fell 7.2% in peso terms — the largest single-session decline since the post-PASO shock. In CCL-dollar terms, the index collapsed 11.8% from Monday's close. Banking stocks led the sell-off: GGAL plummeted 9.1%, BMA fell 8.4%. YPF ADRs in New York dropped 7.9% in the U.S. afternoon session. Market microstructure showed a clear flight to quality dynamic: buyers of hard-dollar assets (global bonds, dollar-linked notes) and sellers of everything local.

PESO INSTRUMENTS: STRESS IN MONEY MARKETS

Secondary market T-bill yields spiked to 135% AEA — the highest since the immediate post-devaluation chaos. FCI redemptions accelerated, forcing money market fund managers to liquidate holdings in the secondary T-bill market at steep discounts. Several foreign exchange dealers reported that the spread between bid and ask on peso instruments had widened to levels that effectively freeze price discovery.

GLOBAL AGGRAVATING FACTORS

Global conditions provided no offset. U.S. retail sales data printed stronger than expected, reducing the probability of an early Fed cut further. 10-year UST rose 6 bps to 4.12%. EM credit spreads broadly wider by 12–20 bps, though Argentina's idiosyncratic shock dwarfed the global component. Brazil's real weakened 0.7%; Colombia's peso fell 0.9%.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: INADEQUATE SO FAR

The Argentine Finance Ministry issued a brief statement calling the Reuters report "imprecise and not reflective of productive dialogue underway with the IMF." This was insufficient to contain market concerns. The economic team is reportedly in emergency communication with IMF headquarters in Washington. The President's office has not commented.

TAIL RISK ASSESSMENT: HIGH

This is the third stress spike in two weeks and by far the most severe in terms of market impact. The combination of reserve credibility questions, fiscal accounting concerns, and the Fed repricing creates a genuinely fragile environment. Default risk is being re-priced, not just liquidity risk. Clients should maintain minimal long Argentine exposure, maximize USD liquidity, and await resolution of the IMF communication impasse before repositioning. The next 48 hours of government/IMF communication will be decisive.
