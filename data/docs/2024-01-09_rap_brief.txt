RAP DAILY BRIEF — ARGENTINA PORTFOLIO ADVISORY
Tuesday, January 9, 2024

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Tuesday brought a further, more meaningful stabilization. Argentine risk assets settled into consolidation mode as the initial panic from last Friday's IMF headline began to dissipate. Volumes improved from Monday's subdued level, suggesting a gradual return of risk appetite. The session was orderly with no new stress catalysts.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

1. FX: CCL (blue-chip swap) continued to drift lower, closing near 1,041 ARS/USD. The gap versus the official rate narrowed to approximately 27.8%, approaching the orderly range that prevailed before the Jan 5 episode. BCRA purchased $62 million net in MULC — a meaningful recovery toward the pre-stress accumulation pace. Informal blue-market activity was quiet.

2. Reserves: Gross reserves held at $21.96 billion following Monday's modest recovery. No reserve release operations were conducted. The accumulation path toward Q2 targets is back on track if current MULC inflows persist.

3. Sovereign Bonds: GD30 added another 0.4 cents. EMBI+ Argentina spread at 1,775 bps. Recovery has retraced roughly half of Friday's widening — a reasonable "air pocket" given that the fundamental IMF uncertainty has not been fully resolved, only verbally soothed. Our desk expects spread levels to remain in a 1,750–1,830 range until a definitive IMF communiqué.

4. Equities: Merval up 2.1% in pesos, recovering approximately 40% of Friday's loss. Banking stocks led, with GGAL +3.4% and BMA +2.9%. YPF +2.1% following an upgrade from a local brokerage citing the regulatory energy reform agenda.

5. Rates: Peso T-bill yields in secondary market eased slightly — now clearing around 118% AEA — suggesting domestic institutional flows are reallocating back into carry trades after the brief risk-off episode.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

U.S. CPI data is due Thursday — the key near-term catalyst for Fed policy expectations and EM risk sentiment. Consensus expects headline at +3.2% YoY. A softer print would renew March cut speculation and support EM spreads. Oil at $76.5/bbl; stable. EM flows from Bloomberg data show modest net inflows to hard-currency EM funds for the week — consistent with a risk-on tilt.

RISK MONITOR: SETTLING

The acute stress has largely passed, but we are not yet back to the pre-Friday orderly environment. The IMF situation is the dominant risk — we expect a formal update within 10 days. Monitor MULC purchases and CCL gap closely. Carry demand is reasserting itself; selective accumulation in GD30 is appropriate for accounts that can tolerate a 2-week event risk window.
