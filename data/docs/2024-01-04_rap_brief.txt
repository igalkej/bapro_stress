RAP DAILY BRIEF — ARGENTINA PORTFOLIO ADVISORY
Thursday, January 4, 2024

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Argentine markets continued their measured start to the year. Risk assets held firm across the board, though volumes remain subdued relative to pre-holiday norms. Global conditions remain broadly supportive — U.S. rates easing and EM flows improving.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

1. FX: The official rate moved along the crawling peg trajectory (approx. 2% monthly depreciation), closing near 812 ARS/USD in the MULC. Blue-chip swap (CCL) eased slightly to 1,034, narrowing the gap to ~27%. Parallel market activity remains contained; no notable divergence from recent trend.

2. Reserves: BCRA reported $22.15 billion gross. Net purchases in MULC today were approximately $55 million, maintaining the accumulation streak. The central bank's stated target is to bring net reserves (currently deeply negative) to positive territory by Q2 2024 — an ambitious but achievable goal if the current import compression policy holds.

3. Sovereign Debt: GD29 (2029 dollar bond) was bid up 0.6 cents today, pricing a further tightening in spread. Country risk as measured by the EMBI+ Argentina strip declined 25 bps to 1,760 bps. Still among the highest country spreads globally, but the re-rating trend is intact. GD35 also firmer.

4. Local Equities: Merval gained 1.8% in pesos. Banking stocks — Galicia (GGAL), Macro (BMA) — outperformed on speculation of a normalized short-term rate environment. YPF led energy names.

5. Inflation: The December 2023 CPI print is due next week. Market consensus clusters around 26–28% monthly — which, if realized, would mark the peak of the current shock cycle before disinflation sets in under the new fiscal anchor. The government's monthly surplus target is key.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

Fed minutes released today showed broad consensus around maintaining restrictive policy until 2% inflation is clearly in sight, but the pivot language is increasingly data-dependent. 10-year UST settled at 3.94% — slightly higher than Tuesday but still well below the October 2023 peak. Oil is stable near $77/bbl. No major EM shock catalysts visible.

RISK MONITOR: MILDLY ELEVATED

Stress level is slightly above neutral as we watch import restrictions' impact on the real economy and the pace of BCRA reserve accumulation. Near-term debt service is manageable. The main tail risk remains a political shock or IMF negotiation breakdown. For now, the trajectory is orderly with improving carry conditions.
