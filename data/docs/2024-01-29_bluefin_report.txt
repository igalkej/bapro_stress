BLUEFIN ECONOMIC COMMENTARY — SOUTHERN CONE MARKETS
Monday, January 29, 2024

Argentine markets opened the final week of January in the calmest conditions of the month. Our composite stress indicator printed at -1.81 — its lowest reading since we began tracking in Q4 2023 — reflecting a deeply benign combination of improving fundamentals, supportive carry dynamics, and an absence of any identifiable stress catalyst. The session was characterized by orderly flows, tight bid-ask spreads, and improving market depth.

FX: BELOW 1,000 — A SUSTAINED SIGNAL

The CCL (blue-chip swap) continued below the 1,000 ARS/USD level, closing at 987. The FX gap is now 21.4% versus the official rate — the narrowest of the entire Milei administration era. BCRA net purchases in MULC of $122 million represent the highest single-session accumulation of 2024, with export settlement inflows elevated as early-February positioning kicks in. The official reserve stance is now clearly accumulation mode, no longer defense mode.

Import normalization is visibly underway: the time-to-payment for import letters of credit has normalized to 30 days from the 60–90 day distortions that prevailed under the prior regime's capital controls. This is a genuine structural improvement in trade finance conditions, reducing the shadow cost of importing and improving corporate supply chains.

SOVEREIGN DEBT: COMPRESSION THESIS INTACT

GD30 at 88.1 cents on the dollar — up another 0.5 cents. GD35 at 57.8 cents, approaching the coveted 60-cent level that would make many EM duration mandates eligible to hold the instrument. EMBI+ Argentina at 1,558 bps. The 1,500 bps target — which would represent a full re-rating to "distressed but functional" from "restructuring candidate" — is within striking distance.

Secondary market liquidity is excellent: average daily traded volume in Argentine sovereign bonds is near the highest since the bonds were issued in 2020. Real-money accounts — pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth fund mandates — are returning as buyers after being sidelined during the January volatility.

MONETARY AGGREGATES: POSITIVE TREND

The BCRA released its weekly monetary report: the stock of remunerated liabilities (Letras del Tesoro and successor instruments) declined for the second consecutive week. The pace of quasi-fiscal cleanup is exceeding internal government projections. Combined with the disinflation trend (January CPI nowcast: 19.4%), the monetary normalization path is increasingly credible.

GLOBAL

Fed FOMC meeting begins tomorrow; no policy change expected. The market is focused on Powell's press conference language. 10-year UST at 4.01%. EM credit conditions broadly supportive — EMBI Global (ex-Argentina) tightened 4 bps on the session. Brent crude at $81.1/bbl — highest of the year, positive for Argentine energy exporters. Argentina among the top three EM performers year-to-date.

OUTLOOK: DEEPLY CONSTRUCTIVE

We see no identifiable near-term stress catalysts. The compression thesis is intact. Carry conditions are the best of 2024. We maintain overweight sovereign, overweight equities (particularly energy), and neutral-to-underweight domestic peso rates (curve too flat to add meaningful duration). The primary risk is external: a hawkish Fed surprise or global growth shock would affect all EM, with Argentina's high spread level providing some buffer relative to tighter EM credits.
