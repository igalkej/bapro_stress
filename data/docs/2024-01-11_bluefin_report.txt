*** SECOND STRESS EPISODE — SEVERE MARKET DISLOCATION ***

Argentine markets came under severe pressure Thursday following a double shock that rattled risk sentiment across the sovereign complex, the FX market, and domestic equities. The session ranks among the most turbulent since the PASO shock of August 2023, and our stress indicators are back to elevated levels not seen since Jan 5.

CATALYST 1: U.S. CPI SHOCK

The U.S. December CPI printed at +3.4% YoY — materially above the consensus expectation of +3.2% — driving a sharp repricing of Fed rate cut expectations. March cut probability collapsed to 32% from 48%, and the 10-year Treasury yield surged 18 bps to 4.22% in the aftermath. The global EM sell-off was immediate and broad-based: Brazil lost 1.8% in equities, Mexico's CDS widened 12 bps, and EM hard-currency bond spreads broadly widened 15–30 bps. Argentina — given its elevated vulnerability — amplified this global shock dramatically.

CATALYST 2: ARGENTINA-SPECIFIC SHOCK

Compounding the external shock, local media reported that the BCRA's reserve position may be weaker than official figures suggest due to undisclosed swap obligations with Chinese counterparties (an estimated $5–6 billion in PBOC swap utilization that does not appear in the official "gross reserves" headline). While Argentine officials disputed the characterization, the report triggered immediate flight-to-quality selling across all Argentine asset classes.

MARKET IMPACT: FX

The blue-chip swap (CCL) rocketed 5.1% to 1,091 ARS/USD — the highest level since mid-December. The FX gap blew out to 33.8% versus the official rate, levels associated with renewed distortions in trade finance. The parallel (blue) informal rate reportedly touched 1,100 for the first time in 2024. The BCRA was reportedly absent from the MULC intervention for most of the session, leading to net dollar sales of approximately $85 million — the largest since the post-devaluation stress period. Gross reserves fell sharply to $22.01 billion.

SOVEREIGN BONDS: WIDENING SPREADS

The sell-off in Argentine hard-currency bonds was severe. GD30 fell 2.4 cents on the dollar, GD35 dropped 3.1 cents. Country risk (EMBI+ Argentina strip) widened 134 bps to 1,896 bps — retracing the entire post-Jan 5 recovery and pushing back toward stress territory. Argentine CDS widened 110 bps on the day, with the 5-year protection now trading near 1,915 bps. One senior EM credit strategist described the move as "justified re-pricing of default risk" given the reserve revelation and the deteriorating global liquidity context.

EQUITIES: FREEFALL

The Merval index plummeted 5.9% in peso terms, with losses concentrated in financials and utilities. GGAL (Galicia) fell 7.3%, BMA (Macro) down 6.8%. YPF dropped 5.4% despite stable oil prices. When measured in CCL-adjusted dollars, the index is down 9.2% from the Jan 3 peak — erasing virtually all of the early January gains.

PESO RATES: FLIGHT FROM LOCAL INSTRUMENTS

Secondary market T-bill yields spiked to 128% AEA as domestic investors fled from peso instruments toward dollar-linked bonds and physical dollars. FCI (local money market) redemptions are reportedly elevated, pressuring fund managers to sell peso Treasury instruments into an illiquid market.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

The Fed repricing is the dominant external driver. A delayed first U.S. rate cut is unambiguously negative for EM assets with external financing needs — and Argentina, despite not having market access, is highly sensitive to the global dollar tightness narrative through its IMF negotiations and reserve dynamics. Brent oil fell 1.4% to $75.7/bbl. EM currencies broadly softer.

OUTLOOK: HIGH STRESS

This is a genuine dual-shock event — external (Fed repricing) plus idiosyncratic (reserve credibility). The key near-term questions: (1) Will the government provide clarifying data on the reserve position? (2) Can the BCRA resume accumulation? (3) Will the IMF negotiations be affected? Until these questions are answered, we expect continued widening spreads and flight to quality to dominate. Clients should reduce exposure to long-duration Argentine sovereign paper and increase liquidity buffers.
