BLOOMBERG MARKET WRAP — ARGENTINA & EM DESK
Friday, January 5, 2024
*** STRESS ALERT — HIGH VOLATILITY SESSION ***

Argentine markets suffered a sharp deterioration Friday as a confluence of negative catalysts triggered flight-to-quality flows, a widening of the FX gap, and a significant sell-off across sovereign bonds and equities. The session marked the worst single-day move in Argentine risk assets since the post-PASO shock of August 2023.

CATALYST: The day began with a report — later partially denied but not fully retracted — that IMF staff-level negotiations had stalled over disagreement on the pace of reserve accumulation targets and the treatment of BCRA's remunerated liabilities in the definition of the fiscal surplus. The market reaction was swift and severe: Argentine 5-year CDS widened 145 basis points intraday before partially recovering, closing up 98 bps at 1,892 bps. The 30-year global dollar bond (GD35) dropped 2.1 cents on the dollar in its worst session in weeks.

FX COLLAPSE RISK REPRICED

The FX gap blew out dramatically. The blue-chip swap (CCL) jumped 4.2% to 1,077 pesos per dollar as risk aversion triggered a scramble for dollar-denominated instruments. The official wholesale rate remained anchored near 815 ARS/USD (the BCRA intervened), but the gap widened to approximately 32.2% — the largest in three weeks — threatening to reignite import/export distortions that the crawling peg framework was designed to suppress. Local traders reported difficulty sourcing dollar bonds in size as bid-ask spreads widened sharply.

RESERVES UNDER PRESSURE

The BCRA reported that it sold approximately $120 million in the MULC session — a stark reversal from the accumulation streak — as dollar demand spiked from importers and financial agents seeking to hedge. Gross reserves fell to $21.93 billion. The 22-session net purchasing streak has officially ended. Market participants warned that if IMF uncertainty persists through next week, reserve pressure could accelerate as import demand front-loads.

SOVEREIGN DEFAULT RISK REPRICED

Argentine dollar bonds sold off across the curve in what traders described as "orderly but concerning" selling. The GD29 dropped 1.8 cents, the GD30 fell 2.0 cents, and the GD41 lost 2.4 cents — the longer end absorbing the most pain as credit risk re-pricing at the long end reflects heightened default risk expectations. EMBI+ Argentina spread widened to 1,841 bps. One EM credit desk managing director noted: "The market is repricing the probability of a renegotiation — not yet full default, but the risk premium is moving in the wrong direction."

LOCAL EQUITIES IN FREEFALL

The Merval index tumbled 4.7% in peso terms — the largest single-day decline since October — and lost 6.1% when measured in CCL-adjusted dollar terms. Banking stocks bore the brunt: Grupo Financiero Galicia (GGAL) fell 6.2%, Banco Macro (BMA) dropped 5.8%. YPF shed 4.9% amid concerns over the government's ability to fund energy subsidies if the IMF program unravels.

GLOBAL CONTEXT: COMPOUNDS STRESS

The global backdrop offered no relief. U.S. non-farm payrolls for December printed at +216,000, well above consensus of +175,000, triggering a sharp repricing of Fed rate cut expectations. The probability of a March cut collapsed from 72% to 48% in a single session. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 14 bps to 4.06%, triggering a broad EM sell-off. Brazil's BRL depreciated 1.3%, Mexico's MXN fell 1.1%, and EM hard-currency spreads widened across the board. Argentina's idiosyncratic vulnerability amplified the global shock.

Oil declined 1.8% to $75.6/bbl, reducing the near-term support for energy exports and fiscal revenues.

RISK OUTLOOK: ELEVATED

The combination of IMF negotiation uncertainty, a reserve loss reversal, widening FX gap, and surging U.S. yields creates a genuinely stressed outlook entering next week. The government's response — whether through accelerated fiscal measures, emergency IMF communication, or FX market intervention — will be pivotal. Spread compression is on hold; the current environment is one of flight to quality and risk-off positioning. A failure to provide clarity over the weekend risks a further deterioration on Monday open.
