BLOOMBERG MARKET WRAP — ARGENTINA & EM DESK
Tuesday, January 2, 2024

Argentine markets opened 2024 on a cautiously constructive note, with the peso holding broadly stable against the dollar in the official wholesale channel and the FX gap narrowing marginally relative to the December close. The blue-chip swap rate eased to around 990 pesos per dollar, compressing the parallel premium to roughly 27% — a level not seen since early Q4 2023 and one that market participants attributed to continued importer demand restraint following the Milei administration's December devaluation shock.

BCRA reserves recovered modestly through the holiday period, with gross international reserves edging toward $22.1 billion as of Friday's close. Net reserve coverage remains thin — estimates put freely usable reserves at negative territory when accounting for swap lines and IMF obligations — but the central bank's net purchasing streak in the MULC official market extended to its 22nd consecutive session, a streak that has significantly bolstered market confidence heading into the first full week of the year.

On the sovereign credit front, Argentine dollar bonds were broadly firmer in early trading. The GD30 issue gained 0.4 cents on the dollar, pushing its yield closer to 24.8%. Traders noted that carry demand from EM-focused accounts was supportive, with no meaningful headline risk to dislodge the constructive backdrop. Credit default swap spreads on Argentina's 5-year tenor tightened by roughly 18 basis points to near 1,790 basis points — a notable compression from the panic levels seen post-election but still reflecting substantial default risk embedded in sovereign pricing.

The Merval index in Buenos Aires advanced 1.2% in peso terms, led by energy and banking shares. Viewed in dollar terms — using the CCL (contado con liquidación) rate — the index remains near multi-year highs, reflecting continued confidence among domestic investors in the devaluation-adjusted equity thesis. YPF ADRs in New York were fractionally higher in pre-market trading.

Global backdrop remains supportive. U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs following soft ISM manufacturing data, with the 10-year benchmark settling near 3.92%. The Federal Reserve's December dot plot signaled three rate cuts in 2024, and market implied probabilities currently price a 72% chance of a first 25bp cut by the March FOMC meeting. Easier U.S. financial conditions generally support EM risk appetite, benefiting Argentine external bonds.

Oil markets opened the year with Brent crude near $77 per barrel, steady amid thin holiday liquidity. The commodity is important for Argentine external accounts, given YPF's production profile and fuel subsidy dynamics. Soy futures in Chicago held near $468 per bushel, broadly supportive of the peso agricultural export outlook ahead of the harvest season in Q2.

Locally, the IMF's Article IV review is expected to dominate policy discussions in January. Argentine authorities are in advanced talks on a new Extended Fund Facility, with fiscal surplus commitments and reserve accumulation targets as core conditions. Markets appear to have priced in a benign outcome — failure to agree on new targets would likely trigger renewed spread widening and peso pressure.

Summary: Orderly flows, compression in the parallel FX premium, and a supportive global backdrop set a muted but positive tone for the year's first session. Carry demand is intact; no immediate systemic stress triggers are visible.
