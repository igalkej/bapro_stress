BLUEFIN ECONOMIC COMMENTARY — SOUTHERN CONE MARKETS
Wednesday, January 24, 2024

Wednesday's session extended the post-IMF compression, with Argentine assets consolidating their gains in an orderly, low-volatility environment. Our composite stress indicator is now in negative territory — meaning conditions are actually calmer than the historical baseline — for the first time in 2024. This is a notable inflection.

FX DYNAMICS

The CCL (blue-chip swap) eased further to 1,014 ARS/USD. The FX gap is now 24.8% — within the zone our model identifies as "manageable compression territory." The BCRA's MULC purchases remain robust at $98 million net today. Importantly, the composition of demand has shifted: financial agents who were net buyers of dollars two weeks ago are now net peso holders, extracting carry from the 116% annual effective yield environment. This is the hallmark of a functioning carry trade, the bedrock of EM stabilization.

The incoming IMF disbursement (SDR 800M ≈ $1.07 billion USD) is expected to hit the BCRA's account by Friday or early next week. This will provide a substantial boost to gross reserves and will likely push the official gross figure above $23 billion for the first time since November 2023. The psychological impact is significant.

RESERVE MATH

Gross reserves at $22.53 billion. Net of swaps and IMF (gross measure), approximately $22.4 billion. Net of all liabilities (strict IMF program definition), approximately negative $4.9 billion — improved from negative $6.2 billion at end-December. The direction is unambiguously positive, and the incoming disbursement will accelerate the improvement.

MONETARY UPDATE

Core inflation dynamics are improving. Our January CPI nowcast has moved down to 19.8% monthly — below the psychologically important 20% threshold. If confirmed, this would be the first sub-20% monthly print since September 2023 (before the pre-PASO shock). The government has cited electricity tariff increases and transport fare hikes as offsetting factors, but demand compression driven by real wage losses is proving a powerful disinflationary force.

SOVEREIGN DEBT: ORDERLY COMPRESSION

GD30 added 0.4 cents in quiet trading; EMBI+ at 1,628 bps — continued tightening. Market depth is improving: bid-ask spreads on GD30 are back to sub-10 cents per dollar, the tightest since before the January volatility. We are seeing selective new buyers from real-money accounts (insurance companies, pension funds with EM mandates) that had avoided Argentina during the stress period.

GLOBAL

Global conditions remain supportive: Davos consensus is leaning toward a more cautious but not pessimistic outlook. The Fed's January FOMC meeting is next week — no policy change expected, but Powell's press conference language on the pace of future cuts will be watched closely. 10-year UST at 4.03%; EM broadly constructive.

SUMMARY: Orderly, low-volatility compression with improving fundamentals. The January stress cycle is firmly in the rearview mirror. Carry demand and improving reserve dynamics are the dominant market themes. We are fully constructive on Argentine sovereign exposure.
