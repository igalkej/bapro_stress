BLOOMBERG MARKET WRAP — ARGENTINA & EM DESK
Wednesday, January 10, 2024

Argentine markets maintained a modestly elevated tone Wednesday as investors weighed conflicting signals: continued recovery in sovereign bonds and MULC inflows on one hand, and a slightly disappointing domestic CPI revision that tempered near-term disinflation expectations on the other. The overall session was firm but cautious, with traders hesitant to add risk ahead of U.S. CPI data due Thursday.

FX MARKETS

The CCL rate edged fractionally lower to 1,038 ARS/USD, with the official gap narrowing to 27.2%. BCRA net purchases in MULC came in at $74 million — the strongest single-session accumulation since the Dec 30 pre-holiday trade — providing a notable confidence signal. Import flows remain compressed, and exporters continue to settle at the mandated split between the MULC and blend rates.

The BCRA also signaled via a technical communiqué that it plans to accelerate the phase-in of the "Phase 2" FX normalization framework in Q1 — a process involving gradual unification of the official and financial exchange rates. While no timeline was given, the communication was read as constructive by peso-bond investors.

RESERVES

Gross international reserves rose to $22.18 billion — the highest level since the post-devaluation shock. Net reserve coverage, while still deeply negative on strict definitions, is improving week over week. The IMF technical team is reportedly satisfied with the pace of MULC accumulation, even if the headline gross/net discrepancy remains a friction point in formal negotiations.

SOVEREIGN DEBT

GD30 added 0.3 cents; country risk (EMBI+) is now at 1,762 bps — almost completely retraced from the Jan 5 spike. The compression reflects both carry demand from dedicated EM investors and modest secondary market activity from domestic banks rotating out of peso instruments into dollar-linked paper. However, volumes remain below pre-spike averages, suggesting the recovery is technically driven rather than fundamentally motivated.

DOMESTIC MACRO

A provincial-level CPI release from Buenos Aires Province showed December inflation at 28.4% — slightly above the national consensus of 26–27%. While not a definitive indicator for the national figure, it tempers optimism about a sharp disinflation inflection in Q1. The Milei administration's zero-fiscal-deficit target remains intact for now, and electricity tariff increases scheduled for mid-January will likely add further pressure to February CPI.

GLOBAL

U.S. markets in wait-and-see mode ahead of tomorrow's CPI. Equities flat, 10-year UST at 4.02%. EM flows neutral. Commodity complex mixed — Brent at $76.8/bbl, soy futures slipped 0.3% on demand concerns.

SUMMARY: Mildly elevated session with ongoing recovery dynamics. MULC inflows and reserve accumulation are the positive story. Inflation risk from tariff adjustments is the underappreciated headwind. No acute stress; conditions are moving toward orderly but not yet there.
