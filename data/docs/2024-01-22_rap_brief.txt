RAP DAILY BRIEF — ARGENTINA PORTFOLIO ADVISORY
Monday, January 22, 2024

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Monday marked a clear shift toward normalized market conditions. Argentine risk assets advanced across the board in what our desk describes as "quiet compression" — the absence of negative catalysts, combined with improving carry dynamics, driving spreads tighter and the FX gap lower in an orderly fashion. Volumes returned to near-normal levels.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

1. FX: CCL settled at 1,045 ARS/USD. Gap versus official is now 28.6% — approaching the psychologically important sub-28% threshold that characterized the orderly period before January's stress cycle. BCRA net purchases of $87 million are the highest single-session figure in three weeks. Import demand has normalized; export settlement inflows improving as early-harvest agricultural exporters take advantage of favorable peso incentives.

2. Reserves: Gross reserves at $22.41 billion. The recovery from the January 11 trough is now $460 million — a meaningful accumulation that strengthens the program compliance narrative ahead of the IMF review. Net reserve trajectory (excluding swaps) is also improving, with the deficit narrowing by an estimated $150–200 million over the past two weeks.

3. Country risk: EMBI+ Argentina at 1,763 bps — essentially back to the pre-Jan 5 spike level. The full compression cycle (peak 1,936 bps on Jan 17 → 1,763 bps today) has retraced the entirety of the January stress across three episodes. This is a notable recovery and reflects a market that has accepted the government's fiscal and reserve narratives.

4. Equities: Merval +2.8% in pesos; in CCL terms, the index is essentially flat versus the Jan 3 pre-stress peak. Full recovery achieved. Financial stocks outperformed, reflecting the normalization of local financial conditions and improved T-bill auction results.

5. Peso instruments: Secondary market T-bill yields back to ~118% AEA — fully recovered from the 135% spike seen January 17. FCI money markets are attracting inflows again.

RISK MONITOR: SETTLING TOWARD NORMAL

The January stress cycle appears resolved. We are moving our overall risk monitor from "elevated/recovering" to "settling." Key remaining risk: the formal IMF review (expected this week) must be completed without incident. Our base case (75% probability) is a clean review. We begin cautiously increasing long positions in GD30 and GD35.
