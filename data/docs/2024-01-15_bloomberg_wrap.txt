BLOOMBERG MARKET WRAP — ARGENTINA & EM DESK
Monday, January 15, 2024

Argentine risk assets stabilized meaningfully Monday as investors absorbed last week's dual-shock and positioned for the expected IMF technical update due mid-week. The session had a notably calmer character compared to the turbulence of Jan 11–12, though the recovery remains incomplete and sentiment is fragile.

FX DEVELOPMENTS

The CCL (blue-chip swap) drifted lower to approximately 1,053 ARS/USD, with the FX gap narrowing to 29.5% versus the official rate — directionally constructive but not yet back to the pre-stress sub-28% level. The BCRA resumed net dollar purchasing in MULC at a rate of approximately $59 million — signaling that the extraordinary import demand spike of last week is fading. Demand from financial agents continues to be monitored; the BCRA is reportedly in communication with the top 20 banks to discourage speculative FX positioning.

RESERVES

Gross reserves recovered to $22.08 billion following last week's brief dip below $22 billion. The partial recovery reflects MULC inflows and possibly some swap-related adjustments. The IMF technical team is expected to release updated guidance on the reserve definition methodology this week — a key communication event that markets are watching closely.

SOVEREIGN BONDS

Argentine hard-currency bonds extended their recovery. GD30 gained 0.5 cents; EMBI+ spread tightened 38 bps to 1,805 bps. The compression reflects carry-seeking flows from dedicated EM accounts that view the current spread levels as offering adequate compensation for the near-term risk. Secondary market activity was notably improved — bid-ask spreads in the sovereign complex narrowed back toward normal levels, a sign that liquidity is recovering.

LOCAL EQUITIES

Merval rose 1.4% in pesos, led by energy names. YPF outperformed (+2.3%) following weekend reports that the government is advancing on a streamlined royalty framework for Vaca Muerta unconventional production. Financial stocks partially recovered. In CCL-dollar terms, the index is still approximately 5.5% below the Jan 3 peak.

MACRO NOTE

Weekend inflation data from private consultancies nowcasts December 2023 national CPI near 26.5% — broadly in line with market expectations. The absence of a print above 28% is seen as marginally supportive of the disinflation narrative under the new fiscal framework. January CPI will be impacted by tariff adjustments (energy up 30%, public transport fares rising), suggesting month 2 of the new regime will show continued elevated inflation before any meaningful deceleration.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

U.S. markets are closed (Martin Luther King Jr. Day), providing thin global liquidity but also reducing potential external shock. European markets were mixed; EM bonds slightly better. Oil stable near $76.8/bbl.

SUMMARY: A more orderly session with partial recovery dynamics. The stress is subsiding but not resolved. Watch the IMF communication this week — that will be the decisive catalyst for whether Argentina re-enters sustained compression or faces a third wave of pressure.
