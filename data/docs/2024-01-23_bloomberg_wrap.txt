BLOOMBERG MARKET WRAP — ARGENTINA & EM DESK

*** IMF REVIEW PASSES — RISK-ON MODE ***

In the most positive session of 2024 for Argentine markets, the IMF Executive Board completed its first program review under the Extended Fund Facility, finding Argentina in compliance with all quantitative performance criteria. The announcement triggered a decisive risk-on move across Argentine asset classes, compressing spreads to new post-restructuring tights and pushing equities to fresh highs in dollar terms.

IMF REVIEW DETAILS

The IMF statement noted: (1) fiscal surplus for December 2023 was 0.14% of GDP — ahead of the 0.1% target; (2) reserve accumulation (using the agreed definition including partial PBOC swap netting) met the Q4 quantitative target; (3) all structural benchmarks related to energy subsidy reform and monetary financing prohibition were met. The Board approved an SDR 800 million disbursement ($1.07 billion USD equivalent), to be received by Argentina's BCRA within the week.

SOVEREIGN BONDS: SPREAD COMPRESSION

Argentine hard-currency bonds surged on the news. GD30 gained 2.8 cents — the largest single-session advance of 2024. GD35 gained 3.1 cents. EMBI+ Argentina spread tightened 112 bps to 1,651 bps — a new post-restructuring tight and the first time below 1,700 bps since April 2022. Country risk has now compressed approximately 285 basis points from the Jan 17 peak in just six trading days.

The move is being described by EM credit strategists as "deserved re-rating" — a reflection that the Milei government's fiscal adjustment is ahead of schedule and that IMF credibility is being rebuilt. Several EM credit funds have reportedly moved Argentina from underweight to neutral, while a minority of dedicated EM desks have upgraded to overweight.

FX: STRONG CARRY DEMAND

The CCL fell sharply to 1,022 ARS/USD — the lowest level since early December 2023. The FX gap is now 25.8% versus official — below the 28% threshold for the first time since the January stress cycle began. BCRA net MULC purchases hit $115 million — a strong session that, combined with the incoming IMF disbursement, will push gross reserves well above $23 billion next week.

EQUITIES: MULTI-YEAR HIGHS IN DOLLAR TERMS

The Merval surged 5.1% in pesos and 6.7% in CCL-dollar terms — reaching a new multi-year high in dollar-adjusted terms. All sectors advanced. Banking stocks led: GGAL +7.3%, BMA +6.8%. YPF +4.9%. The energy sector is benefiting from both the improving macro backdrop and specific regulatory announcements on natural gas tariffs.

DOMESTIC MONETARY

The successful IMF review reinforces the government's credibility in avoiding monetary financing of the deficit. The peso curve is well-bid; T-bill clearance rates have compressed to ~116% AEA, the lowest since the new administration took office. The quasi-fiscal cleanup continues, with the stock of BCRA remunerated liabilities declining week on week.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

Global backdrop is supportive. 10-year UST at 4.04% — gently declining. Davos commentary from major central bankers reinforced a "soft landing" global narrative. EM credit flows firmly positive for the week. Brent at $78.8/bbl, supportive of Argentine energy fiscal position.

OUTLOOK: ORDERLY FLOWS — CARRY DEMAND DOMINANT

The IMF review removes the largest near-term risk overhang. The path toward further compression is open, subject to: (1) continued fiscal execution (February primary surplus target), (2) sustained BCRA accumulation, (3) global risk appetite remaining supportive. We increase Argentine sovereign exposure to overweight.
