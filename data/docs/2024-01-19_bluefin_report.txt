BLUEFIN ECONOMIC COMMENTARY — SOUTHERN CONE MARKETS
Friday, January 19, 2024

Friday provided a further, more confident stabilization of Argentine markets, extending the rebound from Thursday and setting a constructive — if cautious — tone heading into the weekend. Our composite stress indicator is declining from the mid-week peak, though it remains modestly above the neutral baseline.

FX

The CCL (blue-chip swap) settled at 1,059 ARS/USD, bringing the gap versus official down to approximately 30.3%. The trajectory is clearly improving: gap at 34.9% (Wednesday peak) → 32.1% (Thursday) → 30.3% (today). For full normalization, the market needs to return to sub-28%, which we estimate will take another 3–5 business days of consistent MULC inflows and calm communication. BCRA net purchases today were $68 million — solid and above the December average — supporting the reserve accumulation narrative.

SOVEREIGN COMPLEX

GD30 added another 0.5 cents. Country risk at 1,798 bps — now approaching the pre-third-spike level, though still 38 bps wider than the pre-January-17 close. The recovery is orderly. Spread compression is sustained but gradual, reflecting carry demand rather than new fundamental risk-on. Duration extension is not yet appropriate — we maintain a barbell approach with overweights in shorter maturities (GD29, GD30) and underweights in long-end (GD41, GD46).

RESERVES: STRONG CLOSE

Gross reserves at $22.28 billion — the highest of the month. The weekly accumulation from the Wednesday trough is approximately $250 million, which, if sustained, puts Argentina on track to meet the Q1 reserve targets that the IMF confirmed are "tracking internal parameters." Net reserve recovery remains hampered by swap liabilities, but the direction is unambiguously positive.

EQUITY MARKETS

Merval gained 2.3% in peso terms — a more modest advance that reflects partial consolidation after Thursday's sharp rebound. Energy names led (YPF +3.1%, Pampa Energía +2.7%) on the back of improving oil prices ($78.2/bbl) and renewed optimism around Vaca Muerta investment. Financial stocks essentially flat — a sign that the banking sector rally is taking a breather after the volatile week.

DOMESTIC DATA: POSITIVE SURPRISE

The INDEC released Argentina's December trade balance: a surplus of $2.04 billion — the strongest monthly trade surplus in over a year. The result reflects both the sharp compression in imports (down 27% YoY in dollar terms) and a modest recovery in exports despite drought residuals. This data is supportive of the reserve accumulation thesis and provides ammunition for the IMF to view the external sector adjustment as credible.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

Global markets closed the week on a modestly positive note. 10-year UST settled at 4.06%. Brent crude at $78.2/bbl — the highest since early January — benefiting energy exporters and providing a mild positive for Argentine fiscal revenues. EM flows were neutral for the week, with Argentina registering as an outlier (significant outflows mid-week, partial reversal by Friday).

SUMMARY: Settling environment. The third stress spike appears to be resolving, aided by strong trade surplus data, resumed BCRA accumulation, and the coordinated IMF communication. Next week will be critical: formal IMF program review expected. We maintain a neutral-to-cautiously-constructive stance; no aggressive risk-adding until the review is complete.
