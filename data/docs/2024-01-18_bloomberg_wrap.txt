BLOOMBERG MARKET WRAP — ARGENTINA & EM DESK
Thursday, January 18, 2024
*** POST-SPIKE STABILIZATION — STILL ELEVATED ***

Argentine markets staged a significant technical bounce Thursday following Wednesday's severe sell-off, driven by a joint government-IMF statement that characterized program negotiations as "on track" and dismissed the Reuters report as based on outdated technical parameters. The rebound was meaningful but incomplete: Argentine assets remain well below pre-stress levels, and the IMF uncertainty has not been fully resolved.

THE STATEMENT

At 9:15 AM Buenos Aires time, the Argentine Ministry of Finance and the IMF's Western Hemisphere Department released a coordinated statement confirming that the technical discussions are proceeding constructively and that a formal program review will occur in late January as scheduled. The statement specifically noted that "reserve accumulation is tracking internal program parameters" — a deliberate refutation of the prior day's Reuters sourcing. The market reaction was immediate: GD30 recovered 1.8 cents in the first 30 minutes of trading.

FX RECOVERY — PARTIAL

The CCL (blue-chip swap) fell back to 1,074 ARS/USD from Wednesday's close of 1,096 — a 2.0% recovery. The FX gap narrowed to 32.1% versus the official rate. While directionally correct, this still represents significantly wider conditions than the 27–28% range that prevailed before the January stress cycle. The BCRA returned to net MULC purchasing, with approximately $92 million accumulated — a strong rebound that partially offsets yesterday's $145 million outflow. Gross reserves recovered to $22.12 billion.

SOVEREIGN BONDS: SIGNIFICANT REBOUND

GD30 recovered 2.1 cents, GD35 gained 2.4 cents. EMBI+ spread tightened 96 bps to 1,840 bps — substantial compression but still 80 bps wider than the pre-Jan 17 level. Country risk remains elevated. The 5-year CDS is at 1,872 bps. One EM debt strategist noted: "The joint statement was better than markets feared, and the technical rebound is justified, but the spread levels imply the market is not fully convinced — we'd need to see the formal program review pass cleanly to get back to 1,760."

EQUITIES: PARTIAL RECOVERY

Merval gained 4.8% in peso terms — recovering roughly 60% of Wednesday's 7.2% loss. Banking stocks led again: GGAL +5.9%, BMA +5.2%. YPF ADRs in New York were up 5.1% in afternoon trading, recovering most of yesterday's loss as oil stabilized near $77.5/bbl and the idiosyncratic Argentina risk subsided.

DOMESTIC RATES: NORMALIZING

Secondary market T-bill yields retreated from Wednesday's spike of 135% AEA to approximately 126% — still elevated versus the pre-stress norm of ~118%, reflecting residual risk premium in local instruments. FCI redemption pressure has eased, and fund managers are cautiously reinvesting inflows into short-duration peso instruments.

MACRO: TARIFF IMPACT

Statistics institute INDEC confirmed that January CPI will include approximately 30% electricity tariff increases and 25% public transport fare hikes effective January 15. Our nowcast model pegs January CPI at 20–22% monthly — a deceleration from December's 26.5%, consistent with the disinflation trajectory. If realized, this would be a meaningful positive signal for the fiscal framework, showing that the demand shock from December devaluation is fading faster than feared.

GLOBAL

U.S. initial jobless claims slightly above consensus — modestly supportive of the "cooling labor market → Fed cut" narrative. 10-year UST eased 4 bps to 4.08%. EM spreads broadly tighter. Brazil equities up 1.4% in a constructive EM session.

SUMMARY: Meaningful recovery but stress not resolved. The IMF statement bought time — the formal review in late January is the next decisive catalyst. Spread levels remain elevated; monitor the FX gap and MULC accumulation closely. A return to pre-stress orderly conditions requires: (1) clean IMF review, (2) sustained BCRA accumulation, (3) continued fiscal surplus execution.
