RAP DAILY BRIEF — ARGENTINA PORTFOLIO ADVISORY
Friday, January 12, 2024

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Friday was a day of damage control. Argentine markets attempted to stabilize following Thursday's dual-shock episode, with partial success: sovereign bonds retraced modestly, the CCL gap narrowed slightly, and government officials worked to contain the narrative around reserve composition. Volumes were elevated but the mood cautious. Risk-on positioning is not yet appropriate.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

1. FX: CCL pulled back from Thursday's peak of 1,091 to close at 1,068 — still elevated and representing a gap of approximately 31.3% versus the official rate. The BCRA returned to net buying in MULC ($38 million) after yesterday's net sale reversal, which was seen as a partial confidence restorer. Import demand remains high as agents front-load dollar purchases in anticipation of further peso depreciation.

2. Reserve clarification: The BCRA issued a formal communiqué clarifying that PBOC swap utilization does not reduce freely available reserves for intervention purposes (an accounting clarification rather than an economic one). Bond markets reacted mildly positively — GD30 recovered 0.8 cents — but skeptics remained, and the broader 1.6-cent loss from Thursday was only partially undone.

3. Country Risk: EMBI+ Argentina at 1,843 bps — 53 bps tighter from yesterday's close but 81 bps wider from pre-Thursday levels. The spike was severe and not fully healed.

4. Equities: Merval recovered 3.1% in pesos, but this is a partial reversal of Thursday's 5.9% loss. In CCL terms, the index is still down ~7% from the Jan 3 local peak.

5. Global: U.S. markets stabilized as Fed speakers (Bostic, Williams) downplayed the CPI print as not definitively ruling out March cuts. 10-year UST eased 7 bps to 4.15%. EM assets broadly better on the Fed clarification; Argentina's idiosyncratic component remains the dominant drag.

RISK ASSESSMENT: ELEVATED

We remain in elevated stress territory. The dual-shock narrative (Fed + reserve credibility) will take time to digest. The government needs to present a coherent communication strategy before investor confidence can fully rebuild. We maintain a defensive posture: light on long-duration Argentine sovereign paper, higher cash allocations, overweight peso-linked short-term instruments where carry is compelling. Next major catalyst: IMF update expected week of Jan 15.
