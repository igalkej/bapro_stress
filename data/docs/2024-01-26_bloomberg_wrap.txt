BLOOMBERG MARKET WRAP — ARGENTINA & EM DESK
Friday, January 26, 2024

Argentine markets closed the week in robust positive territory. The IMF disbursement arrived as expected — the BCRA confirmed receipt of SDR 807.5 million ($1.08 billion USD equivalent) — pushing gross reserves above $23.6 billion and dramatically improving the reserve optics heading into February. The session was constructive across all Argentine asset classes with no notable stress signals.

RESERVES: SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE

Gross reserves at $23.61 billion — up from $22.61 billion on Thursday, a one-day gain of $1 billion from the IMF disbursement. This is the highest reserve level since September 2023 and removes the immediate reserve adequacy concern that drove multiple stress episodes earlier this month. Net reserves remain negative but have improved substantially. The government has already announced that a portion of the disbursement will be allocated to upcoming external debt service obligations, preserving the net path without additional pressure on the MULC.

FX MARKET: APPROACHING KEY THRESHOLD

The CCL (blue-chip swap) declined to 998 ARS/USD — breaking below the psychologically significant 1,000 level for the first time since mid-December 2023. The official gap is now approximately 22.8%. The FX gap below 25% has historically been associated with reduced trade distortions, improved import normalization, and easing of the capital account restrictions. There is growing market speculation that the government may begin to relax some import restrictions in Q1 given the improving reserve position.

SOVEREIGN BONDS: NEW CYCLE TIGHTS

GD30 gained 0.8 cents — now approaching 87 cents, its highest level since before the 2020 restructuring close. GD35 at 57 cents. EMBI+ Argentina at 1,577 bps — the tightest of the post-restructuring era for this government's debt instruments. The compression from the Jan 17 peak (1,936 bps) to today (1,577 bps) is 359 basis points in nine trading sessions — a remarkable recovery that reflects both technical (forced seller exhaustion) and fundamental (IMF compliance) dynamics.

LOCAL EQUITIES: RECORD HIGHS

The Merval closed up 2.1% in pesos and 3.0% in CCL-dollar terms. In dollar terms, the index has broken through the previous 2024 high and is approaching multi-year nominal levels. Banking stocks led (GGAL +3.7%, BMA +3.1%) on expectation of improving credit dynamics as the economy begins to recover from the December shock. YPF +2.4% — buoyed by oil at $80.3/bbl and Vaca Muerta production momentum.

DOMESTIC DATA

The BCRA also released January's monetary aggregates update: M2 growth is decelerating (monthly pace ~4.5%, vs. 10–12% in the October–November period). The quasi-fiscal cleanup is measurably reducing monetary creation. If January CPI comes in below 20% as our nowcast projects, the disinflation + monetary normalization narrative will be firmly on track.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

U.S. GDP growth for Q4 2023 printed at +3.3% annualized — above consensus, but markets interpreted this as consistent with a soft landing rather than a hawkish Fed signal. Core PCE (the Fed's preferred inflation gauge) for December came in at +2.9% YoY — the lowest since March 2021 — reinforcing the rate cut narrative. Fed expectations for March cuts rebounded to 52% probability. 10-year UST fell 5 bps to 3.96%. EM broadly positive; Argentina among the top EM performers this week.

SUMMARY: Orderly close to a remarkable week. The IMF disbursement, CCL below 1,000, new spread tights, and equity record highs paint the most constructive Argentine picture of 2024. Carry demand dominant; compression thesis intact. Enter February with overweight Argentine sovereign exposure.
