RAP DAILY BRIEF — ARGENTINA PORTFOLIO ADVISORY
Thursday, January 25, 2024

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Thursday session was characterized by continued calm compression and improving market depth. Argentine assets are in a sustained "carry phase" — the environment that emerges when macro stabilization is credible, reserve dynamics are positive, and global liquidity is supportive. Stress indicators are at their lowest levels since the new administration took office in December.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

1. FX: CCL at 1,006 ARS/USD — approaching parity with the 1,000 psychological level. The gap versus official rate is 23.8% — the narrowest of 2024 and the lowest since early November 2023. BCRA net MULC purchases of $108 million today are robust. The IMF disbursement confirmation (expected arrival tomorrow or Monday) is generating anticipatory buying of peso instruments.

2. Reserves: Gross reserves at $22.61 billion. Pre-disbursement, the accumulation from the January stress trough is approximately $660 million. Post-disbursement, gross reserves should print above $23.5 billion — a level that will significantly reinforce the narrative of reserve normalization.

3. Sovereign Bonds: GD30 up 0.6 cents; EMBI+ now at 1,601 bps. This is the tightest spread reading since May 2022. The trajectory toward the sub-1,600 bps target is in sight. Several EM accounts have increased duration, adding GD35 and GD41 as the long-end continues to offer attractive yield pickup.

4. Equities: Merval +1.4% in pesos; in CCL terms, the index is +2.1% — setting a new multi-year high in dollar terms for the second consecutive session. Energy sector continues to lead. Banks broadly positive but underperforming the energy complex as investors differentiate between sector-specific drivers.

5. Rates: T-bill clearance at ~114% AEA — continued compression. The real ex-ante yield (against our 19.8% January CPI nowcast) implies a monthly real rate of approximately -7 to -8% — deeply negative in real terms, which is the government's strategy for reducing the quasi-fiscal burden without triggering nominal rate shocks.

GLOBAL CONTEXT

ECB kept rates unchanged as expected; Lagarde's press conference leaned slightly dovish. 10-year UST at 4.01%. EM equities positive. Oil at $80.1/bbl — above $80 for the first time this year, boosting energy sector valuations broadly and Argentine fiscal projections.

RISK MONITOR: CALM — CARRY CONDITIONS DOMINANT

We are in the deepest "orderly flows" environment of 2024. Compression is ongoing, carry demand is intact, and macro fundamentals are improving. The primary risk is a global shock (Fed surprise at next week's FOMC) or a domestic political friction (Congress blocking emergency decree legislation). Neither seems imminent. Maintain overweight positions in GD30 and selective exposure to GD35.
